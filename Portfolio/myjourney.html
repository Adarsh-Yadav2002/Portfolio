    Actually I was born in oddhisa city because at that time my fatherposted at oddhisa (SI in CISF)

    The memories of childhood ultimately become the life long memory which always brings a smile on our faces.
    Only the grownups know the real value of childhood because the children do not understand these things.
    Moreover, Children’s have no worries, no stress, and they are free from the filth of worldly life.
